A Chrome extension that tracks the amount of time spent procrastinating v/s being productive.

Now whenever you browse a site on that list, a built in timer that tracks how long the site was open.

The extension also tracks when you are actually working.

To view the total amount of time spent on the past 24 hours of browser use, just click the icon.
